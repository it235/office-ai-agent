# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines
- Review code by focusing on key functions and methods relevant to the workflow, such as `Send`, `ProcessStreamChunk`, `HandleSendMessage`, `showRevisions`, and `showComparison`, rather than reading the entire file.

## Code Style
- Use specific formatting rules.
- Follow naming conventions.
